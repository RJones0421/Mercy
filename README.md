# Mercy
Mercy is my custom 3D game engine. This engine is not meant to be used to make games; the purpose of this engine is to deepen my knowledge of game development and game engines through building one from the ground up.

Feature list currently includes:
 - Event system
 - Input system

## Current Work
With some of the infrastructure for the engine now implemented, I am currently focusing on adding a renderer using OpenGL and Glad. This will allow me to explore graphics programming while also allowing me to see any future work I do (e.g. verify physics module).

## Future Work
As previously mentioned, the purpose of this engine is not to make games but to learn more about game engines. Because of this, the modules that I work on will be driven more by personal interest rather than by parts necessary for a game.

List of modules I plan to work on:
 - Level Editor
 - Game Object & Component System
 - Physics Module
 - Hot Reloading
